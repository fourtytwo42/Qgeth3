# Quantum Miner Thread Starvation & Memory Fixes

## Problem Analysis

Based on the logs, the quantum miner was experiencing several critical issues:

1. **Thread Starvation**: Threads were getting stuck in long-running operations (10+ seconds) and not properly responding to abort signals
2. **Memory Pressure**: High NVMe disk usage (85-100%) indicating memory swapping to disk
3. **Resource Contention**: All threads starting simultaneously and competing for GPU/memory resources
4. **Poor Lifecycle Management**: "Abort stale work" messages logged but threads not actually terminating

## Root Causes

1. **Blocking GPU Operations**: GPU batch simulations were blocking without proper cancellation support
2. **Memory Allocation**: Runtime memory allocation during puzzle solving causing garbage collection pressure
3. **No Thread Limits**: All 16 threads could be active simultaneously, overwhelming system resources
4. **Missing Monitoring**: No detection of stuck threads or resource exhaustion

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Thread Management

```go
type ThreadState struct {
    ID            int
    Status        string        // "idle", "working", "aborting", "stuck"
    StartTime     time.Time
    WorkHash      string
    QNonce        uint64
    LastHeartbeat time.Time
    AbortRequested bool
    StuckCount    int
    cancelFunc    context.CancelFunc // Hard abort capability
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Individual thread state tracking
- Heartbeat monitoring (updates every second)
- Stuck thread detection (15-second threshold)
- Hard abort after 3 stuck occurrences
- Limited concurrent active threads (50% of total)

### 2. Memory Pooling System

```go
type PuzzleMemory struct {
    Outcomes    [][]byte // Pre-allocated outcome buffers
    GateHashes  [][]byte // Pre-allocated gate hash buffers
    WorkBuffer  []byte   // Working memory buffer
    ID          int      // Memory block ID for tracking
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Pre-allocated memory pools (50 CPU / 20 GPU blocks)
- Eliminates runtime allocation during puzzle solving
- Prevents memory fragmentation and garbage collection pressure
- Reduces disk swapping by keeping memory usage predictable

### 3. Staggered Thread Execution

- **Thread Start Delay**: 100ms between thread starts
- **Active Thread Limiting**: Max 50% threads active simultaneously (min 2)
- **Resource Throttling**: Threads wait for available slots before becoming active

### 4. Enhanced Cancellation Support

```go
// Context-based cancellation with timeout
ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
defer cancel()

// GPU simulation with cancellation
go func() {
    batchOutcomes, err := m.hybridSimulator.BatchSimulateQuantumPuzzles(...)
    if err != nil {
        errorChan <- err
    } else {
        resultChan <- batchOutcomes
    }
}()

select {
case batchOutcomes := <-resultChan:
    // Success
case err := <-errorChan:
    // Error - fallback to CPU
case <-ctx.Done():
    // Cancelled/timeout
}
```

### 5. Improved Monitoring & Recovery

- **Thread Monitor**: Checks every 5 seconds for stuck threads
- **Automatic Recovery**: Attempts graceful abort, then hard abort
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks active threads, memory pool usage
- **Enhanced Dashboard**: Shows thread status and resource utilization

## Performance Improvements

### Timing Optimizations
- **GPU Base Time**: Reduced from 5ms to 3ms per puzzle
- **CPU Base Time**: Reduced from 50ms to 30ms per puzzle  
- **CPU Puzzle Sleep**: Reduced from 50ms to 20ms per puzzle
- **Staleness Threshold**: Reduced from 8s to 6s for faster response

### Resource Management
- **Memory Pool**: 50 pre-allocated blocks (20 for GPU mode)
- **Concurrent Limits**: Max 50% threads active (prevents resource exhaustion)
- **Heartbeat Updates**: Every 1 second (prevents stuck detection)
- **Context Timeouts**: 10 seconds max per puzzle solving operation

## Expected Results

### Before Fixes
- Threads stuck for 3+ minutes
- High disk usage (85-100%) from memory swapping
- Continuous "Aborting stale work" messages
- ~5-6 QNonces per second performance

### After Fixes
- No threads stuck longer than 15 seconds
- Minimal disk usage (memory pre-allocated)
- Proper thread termination and recovery
- Maintained or improved performance with better stability

## Testing Instructions

1. **Build Enhanced Miner**:
   ```bash
   cd quantum-miner
   go build -o quantum-miner-enhanced.exe .
   ```

2. **Run Test Script**:
   ```bash
   .\test-enhanced-miner.ps1
   ```

3. **Monitor Results**:
   - Check `quantum-miner.log` for thread management messages
   - Monitor disk usage during operation
   - Verify no stuck thread alerts
   - Confirm stable QNonce rates

## Dashboard Enhancements

The mining dashboard now shows:
- Active threads vs total threads
- Maximum concurrent thread limit
- Memory pool utilization
- Thread status information

Example:
```
â”‚ ðŸ§µ Thread Status   â”‚ Active: 4/16 â”‚ Max Concurrent: 8  â”‚ Pool: 45/50 â”‚
```

## Configuration Options

The enhanced miner automatically configures based on system resources:
- **Thread Limits**: Calculated as 50% of total threads (minimum 2)
- **Memory Pool Size**: 50 blocks for CPU, 20 for GPU mode
- **Stagger Delay**: 100ms between thread starts
- **Monitor Interval**: 5-second stuck thread checks

## Fallback Mechanisms

1. **Memory Pool Exhaustion**: Falls back to regular allocation
2. **GPU Simulation Failure**: Falls back to CPU with pre-allocated memory
3. **Context Cancellation**: Graceful cleanup and resource return
4. **Stuck Thread Recovery**: Automatic abort and restart

This comprehensive fix addresses all identified issues while maintaining high performance and adding robust monitoring and recovery capabilities.
