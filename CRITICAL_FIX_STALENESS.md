# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Staleness Logic Issue

## ❌ **The Problem**
The quantum miner was **incorrectly abandoning valid work** due to overly aggressive "staleness" detection:

1. **Geth prepared Block 27 work** at 16:11:13
2. **Miner started working on Block 27** at 16:16:11  
3. **After 8 seconds**, miner thought work was "stale" and stopped trying
4. **But Block 27 hadn't been mined yet!** - The work was still valid
5. **Miner should have kept trying different qnonces** until the block was found

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
The staleness check was **time-based instead of block-based**:

```go
// WRONG: Time-based staleness (too aggressive)
workAge := time.Since(work.FetchTime)
if workAge > 8*time.Second {
    // Abandon work - THIS WAS THE BUG!
    return nil
}
```

## ✅ **The Fix**
Changed to **block-based staleness detection**:

```go
// CORRECT: Only abandon work when geth provides a newer block
// Keep trying the same block with different qnonces until:
// 1. Block is found, OR
// 2. Geth provides work for a different block number
```

## 📊 **Expected Results**
- **Continuous mining** on the same block until it's solved
- **Proper qnonce exploration** - trying millions of different qnonces
- **No premature work abandonment** based on arbitrary time limits
- **Higher mining efficiency** - actually finding blocks instead of giving up

## 🎯 **Key Insight**
In quantum mining, **time doesn't determine staleness - block progression does**. A block isn't "stale" until someone else mines it and geth moves to the next block number.

The miner should be **persistent** and keep trying different quantum nonce combinations until success!
