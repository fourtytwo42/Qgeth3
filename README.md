## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Windows 10/11** (PowerShell scripts)
- **Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools** or **MinGW-w64** (for building from source)
- **Go 1.21+** (for building from source)
- **Python 3.8+** (for GPU mining only)

### Option 1: Use Pre-Built Releases (Recommended)
All root scripts automatically detect and use the newest releases. If no releases exist, they'll build them automatically.

### Option 2: Build Releases Manually
```powershell
# Build both quantum-geth and quantum-miner releases
.\build-release.ps1

# The build system automatically:
# - Detects Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools
# - Sets up proper compiler environment  
# - Creates complete standalone packages
# - Includes launchers for Windows and Linux
```

### GPU Mining Setup (Optional)
```powershell
# Install Python dependencies for GPU acceleration
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer numpy
```

## 🎮 Detailed Usage

### Release-Based Usage (Recommended)

All scripts now automatically use the newest release packages:

```powershell
# These scripts auto-detect the newest releases:
.\start-geth.ps1              # Uses releases/quantum-geth-*/geth.exe
.\start-geth-mining.ps1       # Uses releases/quantum-geth-*/geth.exe  
.\run-gpu-miner.ps1          # Uses releases/quantum-miner-*/quantum-miner.exe
.\run-cpu-miner.ps1          # Uses releases/quantum-miner-*/quantum-miner.exe

# If no releases exist, they automatically build them first
```

### Direct Release Usage

```powershell
# Use specific release directly
cd releases\quantum-geth-1234567890
.\start-geth.ps1

cd releases\quantum-miner-1234567890  
.\start-miner-gpu.ps1 -Coinbase 0xYourAddress
.\start-miner-cpu.ps1 -Coinbase 0xYourAddress
```

### Development Usage

```powershell
# Build and run from source (development)
cd quantum-miner
go build -o quantum-miner.exe .
.\quantum-miner.exe -coinbase 0xYourAddress

# GPU mode
.\quantum-miner.exe -gpu -coinbase 0xYourAddress

# CPU mode (default)
.\quantum-miner.exe -coinbase 0xYourAddress
```

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Custom Node Connection
```powershell
# Connect to remote node
.\run-gpu-miner.ps1 -Coinbase 0xYourAddress -NodeURL http://192.168.1.100:8545

# Multiple GPU devices
.\run-gpu-miner.ps1 -Coinbase 0xYourAddress -GpuId 1
```

### Multi-threaded Mining
```powershell
# CPU mining with 8 threads
.\run-cpu-miner.ps1 -Coinbase 0xYourAddress -Threads 8

# GPU mining with 4 parallel circuits
.\run-gpu-miner.ps1 -Coinbase 0xYourAddress -Threads 4
```

### Release Management

## 🏆 Performance Tips

1. **Use Release Packages:** Pre-built releases are optimized and include all dependencies
2. **Use GPU Mining:** 25% better performance than CPU-only
3. **Optimize Threads:** Start with 1-2 threads, increase based on system
4. **Monitor Resources:** Watch CPU/GPU usage to find optimal settings
5. **Keep Releases Updated:** Rebuild releases regularly for latest optimizations
